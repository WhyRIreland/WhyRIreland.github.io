KNIME Learnathon {data-navmenu="Workshops"}
==============================

Column 
------------------


### Data Science Learnathon with KNIME

<p>
<b>What is a Learnathon?</b>

It's between a hackathon and a workshop. It's like a workshop because we'll learn more about the data science cycle - data access, data blending, data preparation, model training, optimization, testing, and deployment. It's like a hackathon because we'll work in groups to hack a workflow-based solution to guided exercises.

Full Details can be found on the [Career Zoo Website](https://www.careerzoo.ie/limerick/data-science-learnathon.html)

<p>
<b>  About the Presenter</b>

Paolo Tamagnini is a data scientist at KNIME, holds a master's degree in data science from Sapienza University of Rome and has research experience from NYU in data visualization techniques for machine learning interpretability. 
Follow Paolo on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/paolo-tamagnini/)  

<p>
<b> Requirements</b>

* Please bring your own laptop, ideally pre-installed with the latest version of KNIME Analytics Platform. 
* Check the Career Zoo Websit for more details.

### Machine Learning With Julia

<b>THIS EVENT IS NOW SOLD OUT</b>


Join Julia Computing's [Avik Sengupta (VP Engineering)](https://twitter.com/aviksengupta) who is leading a workshop on 'Machine Learning with Julia'.

<p>

Julia is the fastest high-performance open source computing language for data, analytics, algorithmic trading, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other scientific and numeric computing applications. Julia solves the two language problem by combining the ease of use of Python and R with the speed of C++.

<p>

Julia works with GPUs, TPUs, multithreading and parallel processing to deliver seamless unlimited scalability from a single CPU to thousands of nodes, cores and threads in the public or private cloud. Julia has run at petascale on 9,300 Knights Landing (KNL) nodes with 650,000 cores and 1.3 million threads to analyze over 56 terabytes of data using Cori, one of the ten largest and most powerful supercomputers in the world.
<p>
Julia has been downloaded more than 12 million times and is used at more than 1,500 universities. Julia co-creators are the winners of the 2019 James H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software and the 2019 Sidney Fernbach Award.
<p>
Julia Computing was founded in 2015 by all the creators of Julia to provide products including JuliaTeam, JuliaSure and JuliaRun to businesses and researchers using Julia.

### Machine Learning For Coders

<b> Machine Learning For Coders </b>

Presenter: Iain Keaney ( [skellig.ai](www.skellig.ai) )

<p>
<b> Abstract</b>

* Machine Learning (ML) is no longer ring fenced to researchers and data scientists.

* New high-level APIs are driving the democratisation of ML applications and enabling programmers to build and implement ML solutions in their own work. 

* This workshop describes how these APIs work and why they sometimes perform better than even state-of-the-art solutions.

<p>
<b> Time and Location</b>

* The workshop takes place on Saturday 1st February at Thomond Park.

* The workshop will take place on Morning Session (11:00 to 13:00) in a workshop room at Career Zoo.

* The venue is ordinarily a corporate box suite, and has a capacity of 12 people.

<p>
<b>Requirement</b>

* Please bring a fully charged laptop.

<p>
<b>About the Presenter</b>

As a creative engineer, I love to build new things. I've previously worked on a computer vision start-up, developing a consumer solution for mobile 3D scanning. My PhD focused on an  application of artificial intelligence in offshore engineering.

In 2017 I was named in The Sunday Business Post's 30 Under 30 Most Interesting People in Irish Tech.

<b> Why R? pre-meeting series (2017-2020) </b>
</center>

<p>

The Why R? Foundation is a European R user community foundation. Why R? are running a series of pre-meetings around Europe in anticipation of their main conference in Warsaw in August 2020.

Future Why R? events are planned to take place in Ireland as part of the pre-meeting series.

As an aside, Why R? was bidding to host UseR! 2021 in Warsaw, and were in the shortlist of the final three candidates.

<p>




Why R? are also financially supporting a series of R events in Africa over the spring in 2020.

* A [SatRdays](www.satrdays.org) conference in both [Abidjan](https://abidjan2020.satrdays.org/) (Cote d'Ivoire) and [Johannesburg](https://joburg2020.satrdays.org/) (South Africa)
* A series of [Forwards](forwards.github.io) workshops in Eswatini, Namibia and Botswana.


The profits from the main conference are not massive, so the contributions are rather modest (approx 300 Euro per event).
This provides clarity as to what exactly the R community is essentially supporting, if they support Why R? foundation in any way.
