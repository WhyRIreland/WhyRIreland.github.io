Why R? are also financially supporting a series of R events in Africa over the spring in 2020.

* A [SatRdays](www.satrdays.org) conference in both [Abidjan](https://abidjan2020.satrdays.org/) (Cote d'Ivoire) and [Johannesburg](https://joburg2020.satrdays.org/) (South Africa)
* A series of [Forwards](forwards.github.io) workshops in Eswatini, Namibia and Botswana.


The profits from the main conference are not massive, so the contributions are rather modest (approx 300 Euro per event).
This provides clarity as to what exactly the R community is essentially supporting, if they support Why R? foundation in any way.
