### Why R? Pre-meetings Series

<b> Why R? pre-meeting series (2017-2020) </b>
</center>

<p>

The Why R? Foundation is a European R user community foundation. Why R? are running a series of pre-meetings around Europe in anticipation of their main conference in Warsaw in August 2020.

Future Why R? events are planned to take place in Ireland as part of the pre-meeting series.

As an aside, Why R? was bidding to host UseR! 2021 in Warsaw, and were in the shortlist of the final three candidates.

<b> Why R? pre-meeting series (2017-2020) </b>
</center>
<p>




Why R? are also financially supporting a series of R events in Africa over the spring in 2020.

* A [SatRdays](www.satrdays.org) conference in both [Abidjan](https://abidjan2020.satrdays.org/) (Cote d'Ivoire) and [Johannesburg](https://joburg2020.satrdays.org/) (South Africa)
* A series of [Forwards](forwards.github.io) workshops in Eswatini, Namibia and Botswana.


The profits from the main conference are not massive, so the contributions are rather modest (approx 300 Euro per event).
This provides clarity as to what exactly the R community is essentially supporting, if they support Why R? foundation in any way.
